"""Operation router: decides whether a question should enter the calculation pipeline.

The router is deliberately *conservative*: it only routes to the deterministic
calculation pipeline when ALL of the following are true:

1. ``intent["intent"] == "financial_calculation"`` (first gate, from
   ``src.services.intent.classify_query_intent``).
2. A recognized metric alias or generic operation keyword is present in the
   question text.
3. An explicit calculation verb/pattern is present (e.g. "calculate",
   "compute", "计算", "根据...计算", "derive"). This prevents reported-metric
   lookups like "毛利率是多少" from entering the calculation pipeline even
   when the intent classifier labels them ``financial_calculation``.

If any gate fails, the router returns ``NOT_APPLICABLE`` and the orchestrator
continues the normal RAG flow (LLM / deterministic answer extractor).

Layer dependency: ``domain -> finance -> application -> services``. This
module imports from ``src.domain.calculation`` and ``src.finance.metric_lexicon``
(both allowed) and stdlib only.

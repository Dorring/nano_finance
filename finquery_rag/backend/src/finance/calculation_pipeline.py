"""Calculation pipeline: orchestrates the deterministic calculation flow.

The pipeline ties together the operation router, evidence extractor, plan
builder, executor, and renderer into a single ``try_calculate`` entry
point. It is called by the RAG orchestrator after retrieval and context
build, before the LLM/deterministic answer extractor.

Flow:
1. Route the question through ``route_calculation``.
   - NOT_APPLICABLE -> return ``NOT_APPLICABLE_RESULT`` (orchestrator
     continues the normal RAG flow).
2. Extract operands from retrieved evidence via ``extract_operands``.
3. Build a ``CalculationPlan`` from the routing decision and extraction
   result. If required operands are missing, the plan is BLOCKED.
4. Execute the plan via ``execute_plan``.
5. Return the ``CalculationResult``. The orchestrator inspects the
   status to decide whether to bypass the LLM.

The pipeline is purely deterministic: no LLM calls, no retrieval, no
side effects. It imports from ``src.domain`` and ``src.finance`` only.

Layer dependency: ``domain -> finance -> application -> services``.
